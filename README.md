## Introduction 

This is a super cool exercise that I did in weeks 6-7 in the first module of [Ironhack Madrid Web Development Part-time Bootcamp](https://www.ironhack.com/es/desarrollo-web/madrid), in December 2020. We created a web game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Setup

If you'd like to view my project in your browser:

- just open this link: [https://monteromario.github.io/module-1-game/](https://monteromario.github.io/module-1-game/)

If you want to do it locally in your computer, clone the repository following these steps:
-  `git clone https://github.com/monteromario/module-1-game.git` in your terminal
-  `cd module-1-game`
-  `open index.html`

## In-game instructions

Use your keyboard arrows to move Mac-man and eat as much coins as possible. Every coin will add 1 point to your score. Avoid the enemies, every time an enemy hits you you will loose 1 live. Game finishes when you get out of lives. If you find a flower you will get 3 fireballs to be thrown to your enemies. If you find a star you will be invencible for a short perÂ¡od of time.

Try to beat yourself and get the higher score possible. You can use advanced settings to increase game's difficulty.
