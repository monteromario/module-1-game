## Introduction 

This is a super cool exercise that I did in weeks 6-7 in the first module of [Ironhack Madrid Web Development Part-time Bootcamp](https://www.ironhack.com/es/desarrollo-web/madrid), in December 2020. We created a web game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Setup

If you'd like to view my project in your browser:

- just open this link: [https://monteromario.github.io/module-1-game/](https://monteromario.github.io/module-1-game/)

If you want to do it locally in your computer, clone the repository following these steps:
-  `git clone https://github.com/monteromario/module-1-game.git` in your terminal
-  `cd module-1-game`
-  `open index.html`
